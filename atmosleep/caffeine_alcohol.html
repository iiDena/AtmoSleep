                <p>Many people prefer to start the day with a cup of coffee, and maybe end the day with a glass of wine, or another reasonably alcoholic drink. But it seems that these two substances, <span class="highlight"> alcohol and caffeine, can have surprising impacts on our sleep.</span>
                    
                    </p>
                    <h2>Caffeines effect on sleep</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Let's start with caffeine. <span class="highlight"> Caffeine is a class of medication </span>that we call psychoactive stimulants. And everybody knows that caffeine can make them more alert. But there are several ways <span class="highlight"> caffeine can mess you're your sleep cycle.</span> Caffeine will have what we call a half-life of about 5 to 6 hours. Which means that <span class="highlight"> after about 5 to 6 hours 50 percent of that caffeine that you just had continues to be circulating in your system.</span> What that also means is that caffeine includes a quarter-life of about 10 to 12 hours. In other words, as an example that you simply have a cup of coffee at 2pm within the evening. It can be that <span class="highlight">  just about 1 / 4 of that caffeine continues to be swelling around in your brain at night</span> as a result, it can make it <span class="highlight">harder for a person to go to sleep, or maybe stay asleep throughout the night. </span> Another issue with caffeine is that it can change the standards of your sleep. Some people will assume that they are amongst those individuals who can have an espresso with dinner, and then go to sleep fine, and stay asleep. But whether that's true, <span class="highlight">  it seems that caffeine can decrease the quantity of deep, non-rapid eye movement sleep</span> that we've, stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep. </p>

            <h2>Alcohols effect on sleep</h2>
            <br>
            <p>So that's caffeine, but now let's travel to alcohol, because <span class="highlight"> alcohol is maybe one among the main misunderstood sleep aids</span> out there. In fact, it's anything but a sleep aid. And <span class="highlight"> it will be problematic for your sleep many ways.</span> Alcohol is in an exceedingly class of medicine that we call the sedatives. But sedation isn't sleeping. And studies teach us that those two things are quite different. Sedation could be a case where <span class="highlight"> we're simply switching off the firing of the brain cells, particularly within the cortex. and that's not natural sleep.</span> In fact, during deep non-rapid eye movement sleep, for instance, the brain has this coordination of many thousands of cells that each one of a sudden fire together, and then they all go silent, this continues and starts producing these big, powerful brain waves of deep non-REM sleep.<span class="highlight"> Alcohol can also trigger and activate during sleep what we call the fight or flight branch of the nervous system, </span> which is able to<span class="highlight">  wake you up more frequently throughout the night.</span></p>

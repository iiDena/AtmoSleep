            <p>
                Chronotype is a more detailed and scientific way of indicating weather you are an <span class="highlight">early bird or a night owl. </span> Basically, <span class="highlight">your body has a natural cycle  </span>that it follows, <span class="highlight"> this cycle is very difficult or almost impossible to purposely change,</span> although it might naturally change during your life. So, <span class="highlight"> your chronotype is very much influenced by your schedule and your habits during the day.</span>
            </p>
            <h2>What are the different chronotypes?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                As you might have seen on our homepage there are<span class="highlight">  4 different types,</span> 2 types that represent a morning person and 2 types that represent a night person.
                The 2 types that represent a morning person are “Bear” and “Lion” and the 2 types that represent a night person are “Wolf” and “Dolphin”. <span class="highlight">You can learn more about the individual types <a class="readmore" href="index.html#chronotype">here</a>  </span>as well as taking our test that tells you weather you're a lion, dolphin, bear or wolf.
                
            </p>
            
            <h2>What determents your chronotype?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This can <span class="highlight"> vary from person to person depending on different aspects as your genetics,</span> past or current <span class="highlight"> diagnoses, age, geography</span> and many other factors. Although <span class="highlight"> you can determine which one you have by simply answers questions about your day-to-day life</span> and usual habits such as when you wake up and fall asleep, what time of the day your more focused or what you usually do before falling asleep. All these factors are significant to indicate what chronotype you are.  
            </p> 
            <h2>Why Is Chronotype Important?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                You might already have an idea whether you're a morning/night person but <span class="highlight">knowing about your chronotype can help you understand and learn more details about yourself </span> in so many ways.  <span class="highlight"> Your sleep cycle has such an important influence on your life now and long term.</span> Your chronotype <span class="highlight"> influences your appetite, exercise, and your overall functionality during the day.</span> Several studies has found that this <span class="highlight"> associates with personality, health, how you socialize and quality of life.</span>

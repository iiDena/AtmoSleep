                    Sleep is maybe the one simplest thing that we will do each day to<span class="highlight">  reset the health of our brain and our body.</span> And by understanding a bit more about what sleep is, perhaps we can get the possibility to enhance the quality of our sleep. So, exactly what's sleep? <span class="highlight"> Well sleep is divided into two main types.</span> On the one hand, we have <span class="highlight"> non-rapid eye movement sleep, or non-REM sleep</span> for brief periods. But on the opposite hand, we've got rapid eye movement sleep, or REM sleep. 
                </p>
            <h2>Non-Rem sleep</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Non-REM sleep has been further subdivided into four separate stages, unimaginatively called stages one through four, increasing in their depth of sleep. And as we move into those light stages of <span class="highlight"> non-REM sleep, your pulse starts to decrease, your blood heat starts to drop,</span> and your electrical brain wave activity starts to slow down. But as we move into deeper non-rapid eye movement sleep, stages 3 and 4, the brain erupts with these huge, big,<span class="highlight">  powerful brain waves.</span> Within the brain,<span class="highlight">  deep non-REM sleep will help strengthen memories </span>and fixate them into the neural architecture of the brain. 


                </p>

                <h2>Rem sleep</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So that's non-REM sleep. But let's come on to REM sleep, which <span class="highlight"> is the other main style of sleep.</span> And it's during sleep after we principally have the foremost<span class="highlight">  vivid,</span> the foremost mood-altering kinds of <span class="highlight"> dreams.</span> The brain wave activity starts to hurry up again. It's during rapid eye movement that we receive almost a style of <span class="highlight"> emotional attention.</span> And it is also during paradoxical <span class="highlight"> sleep where we get a lift for creativity,</span> that it stitches information together, so we come to life with <span class="highlight"> solutions to previously difficult problems </span>that we were facing.. And it seems that there are implications for understanding how sleep is structured this way. For instance, someone who <span class="highlight"> typically goes to bed at 10pm, and gets up at 6am, they have an eight-hour sleep window.</span> But one morning, they need to get up early for a meeting, or they start the day at the gym. And therefore, they need to come to get up at 4am in the morning, instead of 6am in the morning. Which means they've <span class="highlight"> lost 2 hours out of an eight-hour night of sleep,</span> which is 25 percent of their sleep. They have lost <span class="highlight">25 percent of all their sleep, </span> but because<span class="highlight"> REM sleep comes mostly within the last half of the night </span> in the last few hours, they'll have lost perhaps 50-70 percent of all their REM sleep. So, there are real consequences to understanding what sleep is and the way sleep is structured.
